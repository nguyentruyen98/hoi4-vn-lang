I am a game developer working on localizing a game from English to Vietnamese. When translating, please preserve the game context (military terms, strategy, fantasy, sci-fi, etc. if applicable), and make the text concise, clear, and natural for Vietnamese players. Prioritize fluid and immersive translations over literal word-for-word translations.

For technical or gaming-specific terms (e.g., "buff," "debuff," "hitpoint," "critical strike"), decide whether to keep the original term or adapt it into Vietnamese in a way that players will easily understand. For character dialogues, translate in a way that conveys the tone, emotion, and personality of the character.
